# HR_Analytics
## Preface:
As an company, we want to use HR data on employee features to model a classification problem and predict the probability of whether or not an employee will be looking for a new job / leave the company (before it actually happens), or is likely stay and continue working in the company.

Any successful company will tell you that their greatest asset is lies with their employees. Qualified individuals are always sought after and competition for good talent will always be fierce. Employee attrition costs go far beyond the cost of hiring, training and investment and this used case aims to help companies make better decisions by shedding insight into some of the reasons why employees leave in order to minimize said attrition costs and other impacts of turnover.
